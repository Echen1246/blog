Noyce is accredited with the invention of the integrated circuit, a landmark invention that sets the foundation of all modern compute, and Moore is famously known for â€˜Mooreâ€™s Lawâ€™, the empirical relationship between the doubling of a chipsâ€™ transistor count every 2 years. In short, Intel was by no means a fledgling.\nThere is common agreement when we acknowledge Intel as the pioneer in the vast majority of computer technologies we see today. From their breakthrough 8088 microprocessors to the Pentium chip, Intel has historically raised the bar year after year, leaving competitors like AMD and Qualcomm struggling to keep up.\nHowever, the past few years have seen Intel on a staggering decline from being the king of compute, to barely scratching the ankles of Jensen Huangâ€™s Nvidia, a rival specializing in Graphics Processing Units. This Sunday, weâ€™ll take a deeper dive into Intelâ€™s management, products, macro and industry trends, and hopefully weâ€™ll both learn more about the circumstances behind this phenomenon.\nManagement If a company is a well-oiled machine, then the management is akin to the controller and mechanic. While the machineâ€™s individual parts may be cutting-edge, without proper instructions, the parts are as good as scrap. While this may be harsh, I believe this perfectly aligns with Intelâ€™s leadership team. Intel\u0026rsquo;s new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and his team have, in my opinion, consistently underperformed in the past few years. In an industry where new trends are everything, under his leadership, Intel has failed to upkeep their product specifications, and as a result, has lost a significant portion of their market share to competitors like AMD and Nvidia. We will, of course, talk about product comparisons in the following section, and provide a visual benchmark to help you understand just how far Intel has lagged behind.\nPat Gelsinger is by no means an incompetent individual. His technical expertise as a lead engineer in Intel, and then as the CEO of VMware, a cloud computing company, is well-documented. However, technical experience does not always translate to leadership skills. One of his most controversial strategies is the IDM 2.0 plan, which he lauds as a revolutionary plan to bring Intel back to the top. Some of IDM 2.0\u0026rsquo;s most ambitious key points include keeping all CPU production in-house, and constructing a network of foundries across America. While sound on paper, and patriotic no less, the massive amounts of capital this requires is not only unfeasible, but harmful to Intel\u0026rsquo;s bottom line.\nIn my opinion, as a company already struggling to keep up with competitors on the R\u0026amp;D side, investing in a plan that requires so much CapEx is a death sentence.\nProduct Performance As mentioned in the section above, Intel has consistently struggled to design and manufacture competitive products.\nThis image is a benchmark study done by Tom\u0026rsquo;s Hardware, comparing the Average Frames Per Second (FPS) between a selection of Intel and AMD\u0026rsquo;s top chips. The results are staggering to say the lease. However, while FPS is an important statistic, it\u0026rsquo;s not the only important metric.\nBelow is a chart comparing Intel\u0026rsquo;s flagship chips to AMD\u0026rsquo;s, their direct competitor. I have also added Qualcomm, Intel\u0026rsquo;s rival on the laptop/mobile side of the market.\nTo further narrow it down, below is a table which gives a timeline of Intel and AMD\u0026rsquo;s major releases, starting from 2018. Each chip will have it\u0026rsquo;s description to highlight the advancements of both company.\nMacroeconomic Variables Financial Performance ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/intel/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"intel-corporation\"\u003eIntel Corporation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntel Corp was founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, both giants in the burgeoning semiconductor industry.

I\u0026rsquo;m excited to share my experiences with everyone!\nBecause this is an introduction post, I\u0026rsquo;ll spend this time to help you familiarize yourself with the structure of this website. In order to avoid clutter, posts will be sorted by the Tags and Search function on the top. However, we\u0026rsquo;ll still go over our 3 most important tags here:\nTravels is where I\u0026rsquo;ll share some pictures and talk about cool things I\u0026rsquo;ve encountered on my trips around the world.\nResearch is a passion project of mine; I love reading and learning, so every week on Mondays, I will publish a research article concerning companies I find interesting. If you\u0026rsquo;re a fan of tech or finance, or both, head on over to read my thoughts!\nProjects is where I\u0026rsquo;ll occasionally share some cool coding projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on. I\u0026rsquo;m a new programmer but I love to learn about cool things (which is why I made this website), so please bear with me and my mistakes! The goal here is to eventually produce a timelapse of my progress and become someone that younger students can look up to.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s go over the top bar:\nArchives is where you can find a timeline of all my posts. This is essentially a log of my progress over time.\nBooklist is a place where you\u0026rsquo;ll find what I\u0026rsquo;m currently reading. I\u0026rsquo;ll include all relevant info for the book, as well as a rating and a short write-up. My hope is you\u0026rsquo;ll find some inspiration off the books I recommend :)\nSearch is where you can find a search bar to look for specific posts. If you remember an interesting post but you caaaaan\u0026rsquo;t quite find it, this is the place to go!\nThis website will serve a few big purposes for me. I see writing as a crucial tool for self-improvement, as well as organizing your thoughts and ideas. I\u0026rsquo;m the kind of person that doesn\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking, and many times I shoot myself in the foot by losing track of ideas I find interesting.\nFor the casual readers, I hope you enjoy the ideas I share and find escape from the daily drone of life. For more academic readers, I am presenting my thoughts on a silver platter; please feel free to pick my brain and challenge me. I\u0026rsquo;m always available on any social medias linked below. I love debating, so shoot me a message if you\u0026rsquo;re up for the challenge!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/my-first-post/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"a-breakdown-\"\u003ea breakdown ðŸ™ˆ\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis will be my first post on my website.
