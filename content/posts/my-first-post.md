## a breakdown ðŸ™ˆ	
    
This will be my first post on my website. I'm excited to share my experiences with everyone!

Because this is an introduction post, I'll spend this time to help you familiarize yourself with the structure of this website. 
In order to avoid clutter, posts will be sorted by the **Tags** and **Search** function on the top. 
However, we'll still go over our 3 most important tags here:

**_Travels_** is where I'll share some pictures and talk about cool things I've encountered on my trips around the world. 

**_Research_** is a passion project of mine; I love reading and learning, so every week on _Mondays_, I will publish a research article
concerning companies I find interesting. If you're a fan of tech or finance, or both, head on over to read my thoughts!

**_Projects_** is where I'll occasionally share some cool coding projects I'm working on. I'm a new programmer but I love 
to learn about cool things (which is why I made this website), so please bear with me and my mistakes! The goal here is to 
eventually produce a timelapse of my progress and become someone that younger students can look up to.

Now, let's go over the top bar:

**Archives** is where you can find a _timeline_ of all my posts. This is essentially a log of 
my progress over time. 

**Booklist** is a place where you'll find what I'm currently reading. I'll include all relevant info for the book, as well as 
a rating and a short write-up. My hope is you'll find some inspiration off the books I recommend :)

**Search** is where you can find a search bar to look for specific posts. If you remember an interesting post but you _caaaaan't_ quite find it,
this is the place to go!

This website will serve a few big purposes for me. I see writing as a crucial tool for **self-improvement**, as well as 
organizing your thoughts and ideas. I'm the kind of person that doesn't stop thinking, and many times I shoot myself in the 
foot by losing track of ideas I find interesting. 


For the casual readers, I hope you enjoy the ideas I share and 
find escape from the daily drone of life. For more academic readers, I am presenting my thoughts on a silver platter; please
feel free to pick my brain and challenge me. I'm always available on any social medias linked below. I love debating, so shoot me a message if you're up for the challenge!
