## Intel Corporation

Intel Corp was founded in 1968 by Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, both giants in the burgeoning semiconductor industry. Noyce is accredited with the invention of the integrated circuit, a landmark invention that sets the foundation of all modern compute, and Moore is famously known for ‘Moore’s Law’, the empirical relationship between the doubling of a chips’ transistor count every 2 years. In short, Intel was by no means a fledgling.

There is common agreement when we acknowledge Intel as the pioneer in the vast majority of computer technologies we see today. From their breakthrough 8088 microprocessors to the Pentium chip, Intel has historically raised the bar year after year, leaving competitors like AMD and Qualcomm struggling to keep up. 


However, the past few years have seen Intel on a staggering decline from being the king of compute, to barely scratching the ankles of Jensen Huang’s Nvidia, a rival specializing in Graphics Processing Units. This Sunday, we’ll take a deeper dive into Intel’s management, products, macro and industry trends, and hopefully we’ll both learn more about the circumstances behind this phenomenon.

## Management

**If** a company is a _well-oiled machine_, then the management is akin to the _controller and mechanic_. While the machine’s individual parts may be cutting-edge, without proper instructions, the parts are as good as scrap. While this may be harsh, I believe this perfectly aligns with Intel’s leadership team.
Intel's new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and his team have, in my opinion, consistently underperformed in the past few years.
In an industry where new trends are everything, under his leadership, Intel has failed to upkeep their product specifications, and as a result, has lost a significant portion of their market share to competitors like AMD and Nvidia.
We will, of course, talk about product comparisons in the following section, and provide a visual benchmark to help you understand
just how far Intel has lagged behind.


**Pat Gelsinger** is by no means an incompetent individual. His technical expertise as a lead engineer in Intel, and then as the CEO of VMware, a cloud computing company, is well-documented. However, technical experience does not always translate to leadership skills.
One of his most controversial strategies is the IDM 2.0 plan, which he lauds as a revolutionary plan 
to bring Intel back to the top. Some of IDM 2.0's most ambitious key points include keeping all CPU production in-house, and constructing a network of 
foundries across America. While sound on paper, and patriotic no less, the massive amounts of capital this 
requires is not only unfeasible, but harmful to Intel's bottom line. 


In my opinion, as a company already struggling to keep up with competitors on the R&D side, investing in a plan that requires so much 
CapEx is a death sentence.


## Product Performance

As mentioned in the section above, Intel has consistently struggled to design and manufacture 
competitive products. 

This image is a benchmark study done by Tom's Hardware, comparing the Average Frames Per Second (FPS) between a selection of Intel and AMD's top chips.
The results are staggering to say the lease. However, while FPS is an important statistic,
it's not the only important metric.

Below is a chart comparing Intel's flagship chips to AMD's, their direct competitor. I have also added Qualcomm, 
Intel's rival on the laptop/mobile side of the market.

To further narrow it down, below is a table which gives a timeline of Intel and AMD's major releases, starting from 2018.
Each chip will have it's description to highlight the advancements of both company.
